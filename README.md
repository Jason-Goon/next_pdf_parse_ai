# Next.js TypeScript PDF Parser and OpenAI Interaction

This repository hosts a React-based Next.js application that digitizes a unique process of parsing PDF documents, crafting prompts from the extracted text, and interacting with OpenAI to generate responses.

## About the Project

This application uses TypeScript and React within the Next.js framework to upload PDF files, extract text, and then use this text to craft queries that are sent to OpenAI's API. The answers from OpenAI are then displayed to the user, offering a streamlined educational tool for exploring AI-based text interaction.
